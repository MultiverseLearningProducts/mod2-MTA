## You are going to be come a Microsoft Technical Associate by gaining an industry recognised qualification.

We are going to build a frontend application that will use or touch upon all the knowledge required to pass the Microsoft Technical Associate Exam (MTA 70-480 Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3). It is a peer to peer audio composition app where you can create tracks, play them back, share them with the network of other composers, and play their compositions in your player.

Along the way you’ll come across; italic bullet points, these are the MTA learning objectives, slide shows these usually require a little commentary from your coach, but often contain useful coding examples, links and mini quizzes that test your knowledge. At the end of the module you’ll have lots of practice questions to test your understanding and get used to the style of exam questions.
